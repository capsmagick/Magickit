- **User Statistics**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting

**Key Features:**
- `getAllUsers()` - Paginated user listing with search, filtering, and sorting
- `getUserById()` - Detailed user information with sessions and activity
- `updateUserProfile()` - Extended profile management beyond Better Auth basics
- `getUserActivityHistory()` - Complete audit trail
- `terminateSession()` / `terminateAllUserSessions()` - Session management
- `bulkUpdateUserPreferences()` - Bulk operations for user management
- `getSessionAnalytics()` - Session analytics and insights

### 2. Enhanced API Endpoints

  - Search and filtering capabilities

- **Audit Logs Collection** (`src/lib/db/collections/auditLogs.ts`)
  - Complete activity tracking for all user actions
  - Security event logging
  - Failed login attempt monitoring
  - Automatic cleanup with TTL indexes

### 4. Enhanced Admin Pages
- **User Management Page** (`/admin/users`)
  - Real data integration with pagination
  - Advanced search and filtering
  - Real-time user statistics
  - Proper error handling and loading states

- **User Profiles Page** (`/admin/users/profiles`)
  - Enhanced profile management with real data
  - Bulk operations for user preferences
  - Social media integration
  - Theme and notification preferences

- **Sessions Management Page** (`/admin/users/sessions`)
  - Real session analytics integration
  - Session termination capabilities
  - Device and location tracking
  - Security monitoring

### 5. Dashboard Integration
- **Enhanced Dashboard Service** (`src/lib/services/dashboard.ts`)
  - Integration with new user management service
  - Real user statistics and metrics
  - Activity tracking integration
  - Performance monitoring

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Extensions
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  _id: string;
  userId: string; // Reference to Better Auth user
  bio?: string;
  location?: string;
  website?: string;
  socialLinks?: {
    twitter?: string;
    linkedin?: string;
    github?: string;
  };
  preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
    notifications: {
      email: boolean;
      push: boolean;
      marketing: boolean;
    };
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface AuditLog {
  _id: string;
  userId: string;
  action: string;
  resource: string;
  resourceId?: string;
  details: Record<string, any>;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  success: boolean;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized indexes for user queries, activity logs, and session management
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large user datasets
- **Caching**: Session and user data caching strategies
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient bulk user operations

### Security Enhancements
- **Activity Logging**: Complete audit trail for all user actions
- **Session Security**: Real-time session monitoring and termination
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Brute force protection monitoring
- **Permission-based Access**: RBAC integration for all user management functions
