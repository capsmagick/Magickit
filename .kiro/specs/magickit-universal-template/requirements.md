# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Magickit is an open-source universal web application template built with modern technologies including SvelteKit with Svelte 5, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn-svelte components, and Better Auth. The template provides a comprehensive foundation for developing various types of web applications including SaaS platforms, e-commerce sites, blogs, HRMS systems, CMS platforms, and portfolio websites. The system currently has authentication, admin sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, and basic routing implemented. This spec focuses on completing the missing essential pages and functionality to make it a truly universal template.
