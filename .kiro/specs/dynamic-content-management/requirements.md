# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the application from a static/mock-based system into a fully dynamic content management platform with real-time monitoring, advanced media management, and complete admin functionality. The system will enable dynamic content delivery via SSR for public pages, comprehensive admin controls for content management, system health monitoring, and professional media handling with S3 integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the health dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time system status indicators
2. WHEN viewing system metrics THEN the system SHALL show CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and response times
3. WHEN monitoring database performance THEN the system SHALL display connection counts, query performance, and storage metrics
4. WHEN checking application health THEN the system SHALL show service status, error rates, and uptime statistics
5. IF system metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL highlight critical issues and provide alerts

### Requirement 5: Advanced Media Management System
