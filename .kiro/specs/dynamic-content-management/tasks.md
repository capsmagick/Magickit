## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Each task should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Follow existing code patterns and component structures
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Use incremental development with frequent testing

### Dependencies
- Tasks 1-3 must be completed before any UI work
- Media management (tasks 6-8) depends on task 5 completion
- System monitoring (tasks 9-10) can be developed in parallel with content management
- SSR implementation (tasks 11-13) requires content management completion
- Testing phases (tasks 20-22) should run continuously throughout development

### Quality Gates
- All new code must pass existing linting and formatting rules
- Unit test coverage must be maintained above 80%
- All new components must pass accessibility audits
- Performance benchmarks must not regress from current baseline

This implementation plan ensures systematic development while maintaining the existing application's stability and user experience.
